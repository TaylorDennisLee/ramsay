        <div class="Description">
            <h4><strong>Product Description</strong></h4>
			<p>Men wore waistcoats under their coat in a similar function to vests or cumber buns in modern men&#39;s formal wear. Since they were always worn under a coat, waistcoats often employed thinner, less expensive fabrics for the backs. They were often sleeveless, but could have sleeves for added warmth. Since they were most frequently used for formal attire surviving waistcoats are often highly ornamented with brocaded or embroidered patterns though simpler waistcoats were also used by working class men for added warmth.</p>
