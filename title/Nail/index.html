            <h4><strong>Product Description</strong></h4>
			<p>Nails were small, hand-wrought pieces of metal used to secure two or more pieces of wood or other materials together. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, even these items were relatively rare in homes. As with other types of building hardware, the more a home made use of things like nails, the wealthier the inhabitants. Nails could vary drastically in their size and shape, though they were always much longer than they were wide. Machine-made nails appeared toward the end of the eighteenth century and expanded during the beginning of the nineteenth century. These allowed for hinges, locks, and other features to be even more neatly tucked away.</p>

            <h4><strong>Product Variations</strong></h4>
            <p>The databases record sixty-eight purchases of nails of various types and sizes. Many purchases were made by the weight of nails (approximately 1000), others by quantity ranging from two hundred to sixteen hundred. Nails were distinguished by size and weight. In price, these varied from eight pence for two-hundred nails to four shillings six pence for two weight of nails.</p>
