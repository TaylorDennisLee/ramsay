            <h4><strong>Product Description</strong></h4>
			<p>Shoes in the eighteenth century, as today, varied greatly in style, function, and material. While women&#39;s shoes for the less wealthy would have been made of more durable leather, upper-class women&#39;s shoes were made in silks, satins, and callamancos that while beautiful, would not withstand the elements or much rigorous activity. These were frequently fastened with lavish buckles which were also status symbols. Shoe sizing was not standardized, so shoe measurements were imprecise. The most wealthy customer could send sketches of their feet to special order from England, but even this method was not a guarantee of fit. Purchasing ready-made and imported shoes allowed the prestige and craftsmanship of London shoemakers, but was likely not a comfortable option. A further distinction is made in the accounts between single and double channel shoes which had more stitching and were therefore of higher quality.</p>
